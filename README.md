# svelte-template

Everything needed to build a Svelte project, using Sveltekit, TailwindCSS, and Svelte HeadlessUI.

## Creating a project

Feel free to fork this project and use it as a template project.

## Developing

Once you've forked this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

You can also refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) or the [Svelte HeadlessUI documentation](https://captaincodeman.github.io/svelte-headlessui/) to begin styling your project.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
